All of the source files for the homework given in (Alexandra Stefan)[vlm1.uta.edu/~alex/]'s CSE 1310, a course given at the University of Texas at Arlington.

**NOTE**: Copying or using these files as your own in this course violates (UTA's academic integrity policy)[http://www.uta.edu/conduct/academic-integrity/index.php]. Also, it is extremely rude. :P
